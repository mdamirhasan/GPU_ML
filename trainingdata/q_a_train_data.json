In 1987, Yamaha made the first acoustic guitar that could be taken from a guitar rack, plugged in and played at volume, problem free; no more howling feedback, misplaced mics or dreaded extended sound checks.\nThe latest APX600 and AP600FM models feature a unique under-saddle piezo pickup, the Yamaha proprietary SRT transducer featured in the highly-acclaimed A Series range, a natural tone and the feedback rejection and mix-friendly sound guitarists crave.\nAlthough its style has evolved, the essence of the APX remains the same. Today, it boasts a more natural look, a deeper body for better bass response and greater volume, and a new non-scalloped bracing pattern for a responsive, dynamic tone.\nBody Depth and Bracing Pattern\nThe APX thinline body offers incredible comfort, top-fret access and a sound perfect for the stage. Specially-designed, non-scalloped X-type bracing maximizes body resonance for full, natural tone.\nAPX Soundhole : Oval\nThe instantly recognizable APX soundhole thickens lower-mid response and gives a more strident, open low-end.\nPiezo Pickup System for APX600 and APX600FM\nThis pickup uses individual elements for each string to give an ultra-clear, ultra-wide bandwidth signal with far better dynamic response and tonal accuracy than a regular piezo pickup.\nA.R.T. System for APX700II\nThe A.R.T. pickup was designed with a multi-layer structure consisting of various materials.\nBecause the pickups are fitted directly beneath the top board and capture sound from both the guitar\u2019s top and the air inside the body, its natural resonance is preserved. \n   Not my first Yamaha...had 2 APX500III., Sold the 6 months old just for White color., \"And its Awesome \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4cHad a quick hands on and sound is as as good as 500iii.\", \"Package arrived in perfect condition.

I recommend it. \n Yamaha APX600 NA Thin Body Acoustic-Electric Guitar, Natural. \nTake the stage by storm\nAs an electric guitarist in the '80s, if you wanted to play acoustic on stage there were few options available. In 1987, Yamaha made the first acoustic guitar that could be taken from a guitar rack, plugged in and played at volume, problem free; no more howling feedback, misplaced mics or dreaded extended sound checks.\nThe latest APX600 and AP600FM models feature a unique under-saddle piezo pickup, the Yamaha proprietary SRT transducer featured in the highly-acclaimed A Series range, a natural tone and the feedback rejection and mix-friendly sound guitarists crave.\nAlthough its style has evolved, the essence of the APX remains the same. Today, it boasts a more natural look, a deeper body for better bass response and greater volume, and a new non-scalloped bracing pattern for a responsive, dynamic tone.\nBody Depth and Bracing Pattern\nThe APX thinline body offers incredible comfort, top-fret access and a sound perfect for the stage. Specially-designed, non-scalloped X-type bracing maximizes body resonance for full, natural tone.\nAPX Soundhole : Oval\nThe instantly recognizable APX soundhole thickens lower-mid response and gives a more strident, open low-end.\nPiezo Pickup System for APX600 and APX600FM\nThis pickup uses individual elements for each string to give an ultra-clear, ultra-wide bandwidth signal with far better dynamic response and tonal accuracy than a regular piezo pickup.\nA.R.T. System for APX700II\nThe A.R.T. pickup was designed with a multi-layer structure consisting of various materials.\nBecause the pickups are fitted directly beneath the top board and capture sound from both the guitar\u2019s top and the air inside the body, its natural resonance is preserved. \n   The instrument was well worth the money. But i gave it 3 stars because the description said used like NEW, but when i received it it had 2 inch scrape on the bottom edge. Normally used like new is a return with a dammaged box.", "category_slug": "acoustic-electric-guitar", "response": "I don't know the specific gig bag for the APX500iii, but you can consider looking for a gig bag that fits thin body acoustic-electric guitars with dimensions close to 42.2 x 5 x 19.7 inches.", "category": "closed_qa"}

Flourite Black Sand is most effective when used alone as an integral substrate bed, but it may be mixed with other gravels. Gravel modifiers such as laterite are not necessary. Flourite Black Sand is not chemically coated or treated and will not alter the pH of the water. Flourite Black Sand is good for the life of the aquarium and need not be replaced.\nSet-up\nAlthough it is pre-washed, because Flourite Black Sand is a natural product, it may become dusty in transit and require rinsing before use to remove any residual dust.\nWhen adding water to aquarium, fill slowly to avoid disturbing Flourite Black Sand substrate bed. Place a bowl in the aquarium and add water directly to the bowl, allowing water to overflow softly on to the gravel bed. Initial cloudiness is normal. To remove cloudiness, use mechanical filtration (such as filter floss). \n   I\u2019ve been using Flourite for over 10 years and it is truly a superior substrate for planted tanks.

The greasy wall needs to be cleaned with a strong grease remover like Tri-sodium Phosphate (TSP) or rubbing alcohol. Make sure the surface is completely dry before installation.\nTiles should not directly contact with \ufb02ames, steam, or submerse in water. Do not install tiles less than 16 inches away from the top of the stove.\nIt is very important to make your first cut and apply the cut edge to the corner of the wall\nFor the starting row of tiles, cut the jagged edges into straight\nPut the straightly cut side on the corner of the wall and start overlapping tiles in one direction\nDO NOT interlock the tiles in this way, or you will have trouble lining up\n#053 #702 #000 #722 #601 #052\nThickness 3mm 2.5mm - 3mm 1mm - 1.5mm 2.5mm - 3mm 2.5mm - 3mm 3mm - 4mm\nAdhesion Super Strong Super Strong Strong Super Strong Strong Strong\nMaterial Aluminum Composite Vinyl Vinyl Vinyl EVA Aluminum Composite \n   These are awesome!

Ceramic pot: Choose a ceramic pot with a drainage hole to ensure proper water management. You can find these in various colors, patterns, and sizes to match your decor.\n\n2. Terracotta pot: Terracotta pots are classic, breathable, and help regulate soil moisture. Make sure to choose one with a drainage hole.\n\n3. Basket or decorative container: Place the ficus in a plastic nursery pot with drainage holes and then place that inside a decorative basket or container. This allows for easy watering and adds a touch of style to your space.\n\n4. Self-watering pot: These pots have a reservoir at the bottom that holds water, which is then absorbed by the plant's roots as needed. This can help maintain proper moisture levels for your ficus.\n\n5. Metal or wooden planter: A metal or wooden planter can add a modern or rustic touch to your space, respectively. Make sure to use a liner or a separate pot with drainage holes to prevent water damage to the planter.\n\nRemember to choose a pot that is larger and more stable than the original one, as mentioned in the reviews, to provide proper support for your ficus.
